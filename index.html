        <h2>About Me👨‍💼</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a calm and thoughtful person who enjoys the simplicity and depth
          of everyday life. I find comfort in quiet moments and believe in
          growing through experiences, both big and small. I value honesty,
          kindness, and staying true to myself. Life, to me, is about
          understanding who we are, appreciating where we are, and moving
          forward with purpose. I believe that every day brings a chance to
          learn something new, connect a little deeper, and become a better
          version of myself.

          <li>Drawing and Sketching🧑‍🎨</li>
          <p>
            Allows me to express creativity and attention to detail. I enjoy
            pencil sketching, where every line and shade tells a story. It helps
            me to stay focused, improves my patience, and enhances my ability to
            visualize complex concepts — a skill I also apply in problem-solving
            and design.

          <li>Photography📸</li>
          <p>
            Captures moments and tells stories through images. I love exploring
            different styles, from landscapes to portraits, and experimenting
            with lighting and composition. Photography enhances my creativity
            and attention to detail, skills that are invaluable in software
            development.
          </p>
          <li>Coding🧑‍💻</li>
          <p>
            Coding is more than just a skill — it's my creative playground. I
            enjoy building interactive websites, exploring new frameworks, and
            solving real-world problems through technology. It fuels my
            curiosity and enables me to turn ideas into functional, beautiful
            digital products.

          breathtaking views of the Western Ghats 🌄, and the majestic
          Mullayanagiri ⛰️ — the highest peak in the state. Known as the
          birthplace of Indian coffee, this tranquil town blends cool mountain
          air 🌬️, rich biodiversity 🌿, and cultural charm 🏞️, making it a

              >
              <p>
                Tic Tac Toe is a simple and classic two-player game that is
                played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses “X” and the other uses
                “O”, and they take turns marking the empty cells in the grid.
                The goal is to be the first to place three of their marks in a
                row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine
                cells are filled and neither player has achieved this, the game
                ends in a draw. This game is an excellent way to practice basic
                programming and logical thinking skills, often implemented using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features like real-time
                player turns, win/draw detection, and a reset option to replay.
                Despite its simplicity, it provides a great introduction to
                interactive web-based game development.

              <p>
                A Bill Calculator App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                allows users to enter items with their names, prices, and
                quantities,discount and tax, then calculates the total bill. The
                app displays the subtotal, applies any entered discount, and
                calculates the tax based on the provided percentages. The user
                can see the final total after applying the discount and adding
                the tax. The app provides an interactive list of added items,
                where users can view the price and quantity of each item. It
                also includes a clear function to reset the form, bill
                generation in the form of pdf storing of previous bills and a
                responsive design to ensure it works well on both mobile and
                desktop devices. The logic is handled by JavaScript, which
                dynamically updates the bill calculation and UI as the user
                interacts with the app.

              >
              <p>
                A Stopwatch Timer is a simple and interactive web application
                built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to
                measure elapsed time with precision. It typically features core
                functionalities like Start, Stop, and Reset. When the "Start"
                button is clicked, the timer begins counting seconds (and
                optionally minutes and hours) in real-time. The "Stop" button
                pauses the timer, allowing the user to resume from where they
                left off, and the "Reset" button clears the time back to zero.
                Visually, it includes a clean display of the timer, responsive
                buttons, and often stylish transitions or animations for better
                user experience. This project is ideal for beginners to learn
                concepts like event handling, intervals
                (setInterval/clearInterval), DOM manipulation, and updating UI
                dynamically through JavaScript.
